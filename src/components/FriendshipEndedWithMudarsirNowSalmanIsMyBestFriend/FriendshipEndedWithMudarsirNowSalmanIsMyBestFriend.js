              When you canâ€™t criticize your government or any institutions
              publicly so internet memes become a subversive tool for
              communication, and black comedy.

              On the Internet, memes form a popular subculture that continuously
              evolves globally without limitations or boundaries. They happen as
              digital images are copied and re-used with alterations rapidly
              spreading through online networks and social media platforms.
              Relying on symbols and metaphors, they function as an
              often-humorous coded language that cannot be understood in a
              literal sense. This video is a commentary about free speech and
              uses memes as a code to convey historic information that may
              otherwise be prohibited in Thailand. The narrative requires a
              'decoding' process in order to fully make sense, however it can
              also be viewed as a visual piece that stimulates curiosity,
              provoking the viewer to find out more about the symbols that are
              used within it.
